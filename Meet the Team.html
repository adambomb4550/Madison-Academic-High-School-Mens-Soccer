        <h3>Collin Jones</h3>
        <p>Collin Jones has sustained multiple harsh injuries over his career, but is still proud to be a Mustang. He starts as the varsity right wing/right back. If you see him go up for a header, just go ahead and call the ambulance.</p>

      <div class="collinjoey3">
        <h3>Joey Soriano</h3>
        <p>Joey Soriano has been a four year player and is a proven a leader and strong asset to the team. He is very stong on the ball, and his skills make him a great starting midfielder. He's easily the best player on the team... until you him to
          pass it instead of dribble.</p>
      </div>

        <img src="./img/Sean.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Sean Nguyen</h3>
        <p>Sean is a second year player and is exceptional. He enjoys having fun with the team and cracking jokes. He lightens the mood while still being a strong force on the pitch. He's also Vietnamese, which basically means he's related to every Asian in Jackson.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="seancam2">
        <img src="./img/Cam.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="seancam3">
        <h3>Cameron Huelin</h3>
        <p>Cameron is 4 year player with a strong build. He has a high ranking in his Crossfit age group, which makes him a strong varsity defender. He might not score very often, but he can still bench press you and your whole family at once.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="alden2">
        <img src="./img/Alden.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="alden3">
        <h3>Alden Phillips</h3>
        <p>Alden is a thrid year player. He is the quickest player on the team, and he is very strong on the ball. He is the starting varsity striker. His only weakness is when the smell is too bad.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="sean2">
        <img src="./img/Naji.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Naji Combs</h3>
        <p>Naji is very calm on the ball and has excellent passing ability. He starts in the midfield for varsity, but he is very versatile and can play pretty much anywhere. His calm nature could be due to his apparent lack of any emotion whatsoever, or he could just be a robot.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Daniel Collier</h3>
        <p>Daniel is a freshman with a strong build that makes him suitable for defense. He is one of only 2 freshmen on the varsity squad. He kind of looks like Ferb but take away the whole super genius thing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sean2">
        <img src="./img/Dan.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Dan Greer</h3>
        <p>Dan is a second year player. He is a very aggressive defender, but he has much improved over his last few years of playing. Almost no one can dribble past him, whether that is because he wins the ball or shatters both their ankles.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <img src="./img/Ed.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Edward Havercamp</h3>
        <p>Edward, also known as Ed, is a very skilled player. With incredible power and accuracy as well as speed, Ed is an unstoppable force on the wings and in front of goal. He'll take the ball from you faster than he'll take your girl.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sean2">
        <img src="./img/Benito.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Benito Rodriguez</h3>
        <p>Benito has been playing soccer for longer than he can remember. He loves the sport and always supports the team. He has incredible through balls, making him very useful in the midfield. He's literally always the shortest person on the field, but he somehow manages to win headers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      <div class="sean2">
        <img src="./img/Jed.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Jed Mcwether</h3>
        <p>Jed is one of the best goalkeepers in the state of Tennessee. He has proven himself to be an invaluable asset to the team, keeping the Mustangs in the game even when things seem hopeless. He's tough on every day except for Halloween.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sean2">
        <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b52f0623d7b8c421b7dff997cfd1f3d3e8e9ab0/c=199-0-2996-2103/local/-/media/2018/04/09/TennGroup/JacksonTN/636588318621258396-180406-soccer-mt-16.jpg?width=520&height=390&fit=crop">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Colin Richardson</h3>
        <p>Colin Richardson is a freshman and plays on the left wing. He is left-footed, so he tends to be unpredictable on the wings. This makes it much easier for him to get the ball into the box for Alden or Bolaji to finish. His only setback is his underwhelming body mass of 115 lbs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>David Weissenfluh</h3>
        <p>David is a 4th year player and is a great motivator for the team. He plays defens on the left side and is very quick, so he can recover very easily. Just don't ask him about sub-state.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sean2">
        <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b52f0623d7b8c421b7dff997cfd1f3d3e8e9ab0/c=199-0-2996-2103/local/-/media/2018/04/09/TennGroup/JacksonTN/636588318621258396-180406-soccer-mt-16.jpg?width=520&height=390&fit=crop">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Gerardo</h3>
        <p>Gerardo is a junior who also runs for the Cross Country and track teams. While he may not be the best on the ball, he can run onto passes very quick and has reasonable finishing potential. His greatest weakness is the nutMEG.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Bolaji Olasanya</h3>
        <p>A self-proclaimed Nigerian prince, "Big-Body Bo" is almost impossible to knock off the ball. Anybody who dares to try and win the ball from this senior will likely end up on the ground... or in a hospital.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sean2">
        <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b52f0623d7b8c421b7dff997cfd1f3d3e8e9ab0/c=199-0-2996-2103/local/-/media/2018/04/09/TennGroup/JacksonTN/636588318621258396-180406-soccer-mt-16.jpg?width=520&height=390&fit=crop">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Cooper Whitworth</h3>
        <p>Cooper is a sophomore goalkeeper who does a solid job of filling in when Jed is out. He has been playing goalkeeper for a while, and motivates the team well on the field. Cooper is also the plug for fruit snacks at lunch.</p>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Jesse Veltmen</h3>
        <p>Jesse is a junior and is one of the tallest players on the team and has a powerful shot. He can dribble well, and he can protect the ball well. Most of his freshman year is a blur, so don't ask about it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sean2">
        <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b52f0623d7b8c421b7dff997cfd1f3d3e8e9ab0/c=199-0-2996-2103/local/-/media/2018/04/09/TennGroup/JacksonTN/636588318621258396-180406-soccer-mt-16.jpg?width=520&height=390&fit=crop">
      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Mathew Steen</h3>
        <p>Matthew (a.k.a. "Steen") is the man who holds the defense down. He is very strong in his tackles and is a great leader for the team. He keeps the team motivated and pushes them to their limits in a good way. The Steens manufacture a new child every few years in their basement factory, so there will always be a Steen on the team for the forseeable future.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="sean3">
        <h3>Michael Mellorn</h3>
        <p>Michael is the only player on the team who actually goes to Early College High, the school that shares sports teams with Madison. He is a junior and occupies the right wing and right back positions. He's kinda weird but his mom hooks the
          team up with really good snacks. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="sean3">
          <h3>Sy Cavitt</h3>
          <p>Sy is a sophomore who has greatly improved since his first season. He plays for both JV and Varsity and is a great assest for both. He kind of looks like an elf and he sounds like Palyboi Carti when he talk, but you get used to it.</p>
