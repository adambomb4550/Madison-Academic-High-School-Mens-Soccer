      <p> The bigget fundraiser for the Madison Academic Men's Soccer Team is the annual Indoor Soccer Tournament. This past year, it was held at Southside Highschool, and it usually takes place in Februrary just before the season begins. You can enter your own team for a small fee and have a chance at winning a gold medal. You can also sign up to volunteer at our concession stands or other services, which is much appreciated. Students will be given service hours for volunteering.
